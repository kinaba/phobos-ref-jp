* Contributions

Any help is welcome!
- For minor typo or mistranslation, just ping me @kinaba on Twitter,
  or log in to github and use the "Improve this site" button on the translated pages.
- For a new/revised/improved translation of a full document,
  please send a pull request. There's one request for the translation:
  "align the line number with the original English document". Line numbers
  are used as meta data to sync English and Japanese texts.
- If you are interested in continuously volunteering in the translation,
  again, please ping me @kinaba at Twitter.
